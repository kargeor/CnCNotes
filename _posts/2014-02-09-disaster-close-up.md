![Blown FET]({{ site.baseurl }}/galleries/2014-02-09-cnc-board/destroyed_fet.jpg)

Well as I suspected in my [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.previous.url }}) I had blown the FET controlling the spindle motor. And when I say blown, this was pretty magnificent. I have never seen a FET with a great crack in it like this.
 
I will find a replacement part and solder it in.
