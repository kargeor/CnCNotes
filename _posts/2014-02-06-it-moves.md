# The Machine Moves

This time I got the machine moving under GRBL Arduino control, which is a little annoying after I'd ordered a parallel port capable mini-itx machine as a backup plan.

The main problem I'd had (and this is a head slap doh moment) is that I'd read the pin assignments for a female parallel port connector, and forgot to invert the layout for the male connector. I then inverted them, and bingo it worked.

I then demonstrated all 3 axes moving! Awesome.

This lead to the next problem - calibrating and zeroing. This was frustrating as I was learning gcode as I went, and I did bump the end with the steppers a couple of times - watch out for that. 

# Zeroing and coordinates

The important thing to note is it should be a right handed coordinate system - at least according to [G-Code tutorial - Coordinate System](http://www.cnccookbook.com/CCCNCGCodeCoordinates.htm). So after playing with my machine, I determined that it was going backwards on some coordinates. I inverted directions on the X and Z axis - using a bitmask of 160. In GRBL this is a flag set with ```$6``` - <https://github.com/grbl/grbl/wiki/Configuring-Grbl-v0.8#6--step-port-invert-mask-intbinary>.

While playing with this, I also started using [Universal GCode Sender](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender) - a free tool on github that interfaces nicely with grbl - and gave me machine control. This was after learning enough gcode to switch between absolute and relative control systems. It is likely that before each job, I will need to use the manual controls to reset to 0, and then reset the coords in grbl too.

However - note that the reset button here resets the "work position" - not the machine position to 0. I've no limit switches yet - so I can not auto-home currently.

This may also mean homing for each job - some start around zero as the centre of the work piece I think - at least the grbl demo circle does.
