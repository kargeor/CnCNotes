# The Machine Moves

This time I got the machine moving under GRBL Arduino control, which is a little annoying after I'd ordered a parallel port capable mini-itx machine as a backup plan.

The main problem I'd had (and this is a head slap doh moment) is that I'd read the pin assignments for a female parallel port connector, and forgot to invert the layout for the male connector. I then inverted them, and bingo it worked.

I then demonstrated all 3 axes moving! Awesome.

This lead to the next problem - calibrating and zeroing. This was frustrating as I was learning gcode as I went, and I did bump the end with the steppers a couple of times - watch out for that.
