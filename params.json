A device where I can design things and let the computer do the work of turning it into a prototype. \r\n\r\nI finally took the decision to buy one after seeing a couple of Ben Heck episodes where he used laser cutters, cnc mills and 3d printers to awesome things. \r\n\r\nI went looking around for something I could afford and use. I considered GoCNC who have inexpensive machines, but after reading CnC forums, the 3020 type machines are better known. So I bought one of these for less than Â£500.\r\n\r\nIt arrived a few days later - requiring some assembly - attaching the stepper motors. It came with a large control box. This box has a parallel interface - and from what I can see \r\n\r\n[My Plan 30th Jan 2014](2014-01-30-my_plan.md)\r\n\r\n[Unboxing and setup - 3rd Feb 2014](2014-02-03-unboxing-and-setup.md)\r\n\r\n[Connecting it to grbl - 4th Feb 2014](2014-02-04-connecting-it-to-grbl.md)\r\n\r\n[TearDown - Inside of the controller - 5th Feb 2014](2014-02-05-teardown.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
