<p>I have intended to buy or build a Cnc device for years - a 3d printer, laser cutter, lathe or router. A device where I can design things and let the computer do the work of turning it into a prototype. </p>

<p>I finally took the decision to buy one after seeing a couple of Ben Heck episodes where he used laser cutters, cnc mills and 3d printers to awesome things. </p>

<p>I went looking around for something I could afford and use. I considered GoCNC who have inexpensive machines, but after reading CnC forums, the 3020 type machines are better known. So I bought one of these for less than Â£500.</p>

<p>It arrived a few days later - requiring some assembly - attaching the stepper motors. It came with a large control box. This box has a parallel interface - and from what I can see </p>
